# Waggle
Smart Devices for Pets Startup Company
# [Business Intelligence Analyst: Waggle]


## Introduction:
In this project I had the opportunity to delve into the world of pet fitness data for Waggle, a pioneering startup specializing in smart devices for pets. In this project, I was tasked with analyzing data collected from Waggle's Lapdog and Lapcat devices to provide insights that will guide the company's decision-making process regarding the potential launch of a feline version of their successful fitness collar.

## Objectives:
The primary objective of this project was to analyze and compare data collected from Lapdog and Lapcat devices to address critical questions posed by Waggle's CEO and Chief Marketing Officer. Specifically, I aimed to:

Determine if there was a significant increase in average daily steps for cats wearing the Lapcat device similar to the trend observed in dogs wearing the Lapdog device.
Evaluate the satisfaction levels of Lapcat owners compared to Lapdog owners.
Create a boardroom-ready Power BI report that adheres to Waggle's branding guidelines by incorporating the Waggle color palette, logo, and other approved company visuals.
Provide demographic comparisons between dogs and cats using Waggle devices and insights into the families who own these pets.
Include slicers in the report to facilitate interactive exploration and filtering of the data by the product team.

## Scenario:
As a business intelligence analyst at Waggle, a startup that has experienced tremendous success with its Lapdog fitness collar, the CEO's excitement over the Lapdog's success has sparked interest in developing a similar product for cats, but there are concerns about its viability.

To address these concerns, the product team distributed 1,000 Lapcat prototypes for field testing, collecting valuable data over several months. Now, I have been tasked with delivering a comprehensive Power BI report that compares the performance of Lapcat devices with Lapdog devices. This report will be presented at the highest levels of the company and will play a pivotal role in determining the fate of the Lapcat project.

The CEO is particularly interested in understanding if the Lapcat device elicits a similar increase in average daily steps among cats as observed in dogs wearing the Lapdog device. Additionally, they want to gauge the satisfaction levels of Lapcat owners compared to Lapdog owners.

Incorporating Waggle's branding guidelines, including colors, logos, and icons, is crucial to maintaining brand consistency and identity in the report. Furthermore, the product team expects insights into demographic comparisons between dogs and cats using Waggle devices, as well as information about the families who own these pets. To facilitate data exploration, slicers will be included to enable interactive filtering and exploration by the product team.

By addressing these key questions and requirements, my aim is to provide Waggle with actionable insights that will inform strategic decisions regarding the potential launch of the Lapcat device, ultimately contributing to the company's continued success in the pet technology market.
